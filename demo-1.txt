GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time.

What is the main advantage of GitHub?
GitHub provides distributed version controls geared towards tracking and managing changes to software code. In line with this, several developers can work on a Git repository and track changes along the way. Further, every team member can access the database simultaneously to view previous versions.
